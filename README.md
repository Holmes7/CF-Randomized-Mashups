# Random Mashup Generator

This tool helps you find a set of random problems of codeforces of desired difficulty level where the problems aren't solved by any of the members in your group.

## Technologies

* TypeScript
* ReactJS
* Bulma CSS
* Vite, as an alternative to Create React App

## Where can I use this tool

* If you want to host a coding contest in your university etc. you can use this tool to get a set of random problems with the difficulty of your choice which no user has solved. You just need the codeforces usernames of all the participants.

* If you and your friends who want to practice by giving contests together. (This was my motivation to create the app)

* If you just want to practice some random problems that you haven't solved before. (Also helpful if you have multiple accounts lol. One of my friends uses it this way)

## Features

Other than the main problem that it solves, I have also implemented some side features.

* This app stores the usernames and problem ratings that you add as an input to the local storage of you browser so that the next time you visit you don't have to work as hard to add all of them back.

* The generated problem code is a clickable button which will copy the problem code to your clipboard.

* Some of the older problems of codeforces aren't that nice. Many don't even have an editorial. So I have also implemented an option to only find problems created after a certain time.
